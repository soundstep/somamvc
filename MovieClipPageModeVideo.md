## Learn how to use the MovieClip Page Mode ##

Here is a new Video Tutorial about the MovieClip Page Mode in Soma, it might remind you the Flash Catalyst workflow. This mode is only for Flash IDE user. I'm creating a designed site in few minutes by importing Photohop Files in MovieClip that wll be managed by Soma.

The PageManager will instantiate MovieClip instead or pure actionscript class. It is a very useful mode if you want to build your site with the Flash IDE with a minimum of code, and very quickly.
